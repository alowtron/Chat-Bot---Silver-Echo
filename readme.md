# About
Silver echo is a chat bot that has speech to text and text to speech. 

# Front End
The front end will just use html, css, and java script to keep things simple. For the speech to text I will be the Web Speech Kit which should work on every browser but firefox and opera. For The text to speech I am also planning to use something that is built into a browsers. While the mic is active it will be possible send messages simply by saying "send message" to make it possible to use the chat bot without needing to touch the keyboard or mouse.

# Back End
The back end will be built using php. Data that I would need stored will be stored in a SQL database. For the large language model(s) that will be powering this I will be using together.ai.
